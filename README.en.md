# TNT.js
![输入图片说明](TNT.js.logo.png)
### Indroduction
TNT.js is a Javascript-based programming language. It's our goal to make it as simple as Python, and at the same time make it looks like a front-end programming language. The language avoid the cons of TypeScript that can't run directly on the browser. <br/>

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Test Page</title>
    <script src="tnt.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <tnt>
        x = 2333;
    </tnt>
    <div id="content">
        <v>x</v> <br>
        You are using the: <v>explorerType</v>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
The result is:
```
2333
You are using the: Chrome
```
Variable names inside `<v>` tag will be replaced with its actual value.
